Bird Hotspot Locator
--
There are cool birds everywhere! Where can I find hotspots and see what kind of birds there are in a location? That’s where my eBird API 2.0 bird hotspot locator is for! With it, you can look up a location and find hotspots near an area and see particular sightings at that hotspot. After that, you can learn more about the particular bird of that sighting! There’s also an included maps feature and an image search. Hope you enjoy!
